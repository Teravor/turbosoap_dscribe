TurboSOAP Example
=================

Setup
-----
Instantiating the TurboSOAP descriptor is done as follows:

Constructor takes the following parameters:

The TurboSOAP descriptor uses a lot of default parameters which are decent defaults but might not be 
physically or computationally optimal paremeters to represent atomic environments in specific cases. 
The parameter tuning enables good accuracy and quick computation times if parameters are chosen judiciously.

In order to tune the parameters we need to use TurboSOAPSpecie to define them

TurboSOAP can handle both periodic and finite systems with equal ease.
